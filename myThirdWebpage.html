				<h1>Global Warming: Effects on the Environment</h1>

				<!-- The main body of content -->
				<p>Many impacts of climate change have already been recognized which include extreme
				weather events, glacier retreats, changes in the timing of seasons, changes in farming productivity, the rise of 
				the sea level, and Arctic sea ice declines.</p>

				<p><b>What causes Global Warming?</b></p>
				
				<p>Global warming is caused by CO2 and other greenhouse gases that collect in the 
				atmosphere and absorb UV and solar radiation. Naturally, this radiation would escape into space, but greenhouse 
				trap the radiation and cause the planet to get warmer, globally.</p>
							
				<p><b>Some goals we can set to reduce Global Warming:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Change a light</li>
						<li><p>Drive less</li>
						<li><p>Recycle more</li>
						<li><p>Check your tires</li>
						<li><p>Use less hot water</li>
						<li><p>Avoid products with a lot of packaging</li>
						<li><p>Adjust your thermostat</li>
						<li><p>Plant a tree</li>
					</ul>

				<p><b>What are the effects of Global Warming?</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Melting glaciers, early snowmelt, and severe drought</li>
						<li><p>Rising sea levels</li>
						<li><p>Forests, farms, and cities will face troublesome new pests, heat waves, heavy 
						downpours, and increased flooding</li>
						<li><p>Disruption of habitats such as coral reefs and Alpine meadows could drive many
						plant and animal species to extinction</li>
						<li><p>Allergies, asthma, and infectious disease outbreaks will become more common</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Humans and animals alike will face new difficulties for survival because of 
				global warming. More frequent and intense drought, extreme storms, heat waves, sea levels rising, glaciers melting,
				and oceans warming can directly harm animals, destroy their habitats, and wreak havoc on human communities.  As 
				this gets wors, these impacts will have a higher likelihood to occur.</p>
							
				<p><b>Protecting the Forests</b></p>
						
				<p>Forests protect the Earth by absorbing carbon dioxide which is a major source of 
				pollution that causes climate change and turns it into oxygen. To help decrease global warming we can:</p>
							
					<ul>
						<li><p>Examine the vulnerability of forests to global warming and search for ways to 
						help them adapt to the changes</li>
						<li><p>Make use of satellite images and aerial mapping technologies to trace illegal 
						lumbering</li>
						<li><p>Reduce forest destruction and degradation and protect wildlife</li>
					</ul>
							
				<p><b>The Animal Kingdom</b></p>
							
				<p>The main impact of global warming on the animal kingdom is habitat disruption in 
				which ecosystems rapidly change as a response to climate change. Habitat disruptions often occur due to changes in
				temperature and water availability, which affect vegetation and therefore the all animal's diet. The animal 
				species impacted the most by global warming include reindeer, arctic foxes, polar bears, penguins, gray wolves, 
				and salmon.</p>
