				<p><b>Hotter</b></p>
				
				<p>When CO2 is released into the atmosphere, it prevents heat from escaping. This accumulation of CO2 leads
				to a hotter world. Higher temperatures are linked to almost all of global warming’s impacts, including more
				heatwaves, crop failures, etc. If carbon emissions continue to increase, by the end of the century the daily
				temperatures in the US are likely to increase by at least 10°F. Other parts of the world may experience even
				worse increases such as Canada with the country facing a drastic increase in temperature.</p>
				
				<p><b>Wetter</b></p>
				
				<p>As ice sheets and glaciers melt, the ocean rises. This can disrupt and damage coastal communities and 
				every sea-bordering country in the world. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, we could 
				experience up to 8 ft of sea-level rise by the end of the century. Entire island countries look at the 
				likelihood of going underwater.</p>

				<p><b>More Extreme</b></p>
				
				<p>Extreme weather is becoming more severe and, in some cases, more common. For example, hotter air masses 
				and oceans are resulting in more extreme hurricanes, with record-breaking amounts of rain. For example, 
				extreme natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey have gone from occurring once every century to every 16
				years. In drier areas, there are longer, extreme, and more frequent droughts.</p>
				
				<p><b>Threat Multiplication</b></p>
				
				<p>Global warming is worsening existing conflicts. For example, hotter temperatures and droughts will make
				staple crop supply less stable, leading to food shortages. The 800 million people currently living in 
				poverty will be most affected. By the end of the century, sea-level rise could displace more than 100 
				million. Migrations, as well as conflicts over resources, will significantly increase the risk of war. 
				Only a small amount of warming will kill 70 to 90% of the world’s coral reefs and up to 50% of plant and 
				animal species could face extinction.</p>
